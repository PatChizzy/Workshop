## About

This repository hosts the training materials prepared for the **hands-on workshop** delivered during the conference. The sessions combine **Python programming, data analytics, and irrigation modeling** with real and simulated environmental datasets.

Participants learn how to:
- Explore and visualize climate and soil sensor data
- Compute **reference evapotranspiration (ET‚ÇÄ)** using FAO Penman‚ÄìMonteith
- Estimate **crop water requirements (ETc)** with crop coefficients (Kc)
- Derive **irrigation needs** under different efficiencies
- Run **scenario simulations** (heatwave, rainfall, drought) to observe how decisions shift
- Build **introductory machine learning models** for predicting weather and soil variables
- Interpret results with clear and compelling visualizations


## Workshop Structure

1. **Python & Numerical Computing**
   - Introduction to Python, NumPy, Pandas
   - Working with tabular data and time series

2. **Environmental Applications**
   - Weather and soil datasets
   - ET‚ÇÄ and ETc calculations
   - Irrigation demand estimation
   - Comparison of in-situ weather station data with ERA5 reanalysis data  

3. **Scenario Lab**
   - Interactive simulations for:
     - Heatwaves üå°Ô∏è  
     - Rainfall events üåßÔ∏è  
     - Droughts üåµ  

4. **Machine Learning Intro**
   - Predicting **air temperature** and **solar radiation**
   - Model comparison (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, SVR)

5. **Soil Water Analysis**
   - Van Genuchten soil parameters
   - Soil texture and water retention (Œ∏FC, Œ∏WP, PAW)
  
6. **Satellite Resource Data**  
   - **CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data)** - rainfall estimates from 1981 to present, useful for drought and rainfall monitoring.  
   - **ERA5 (ECMWF Reanalysis)** - global reanalysis providing temperature, humidity, wind, and pressure fields at hourly to monthly scales.  
   - **Sentinel-2** ‚Äì high-resolution optical satellite imagery (10-20 m) for vegetation indices such as NDVI and SAVI.  
   - **Landsat (8/9 OLI/TIRS)** - long-term multispectral archive for land cover change, vegetation condition, and land surface temperature.  
   - **FAO WaPOR** ‚Äì crop water productivity datasets including actual evapotranspiration and biomass production across Africa.  
   - **Digital Earth Africa** ‚Äì decision-ready geospatial products derived from Landsat, Sentinel, and other sources tailored for the African continent.  

   These resources will be demonstrated in simple Python/Colab exercises to highlight how satellite observations can extend irrigation monitoring to areas where weather station coverage is sparse.
